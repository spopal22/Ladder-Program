# Ladder-Project

*  This project is intended to randomly generate a ladder leaning against a home
*  Starts with a dialog box that asks if you want a ladder and give you two options, yes which starts the code and no which exits
*  Upon clicking yes it shows an illustration of what we're calulcating which is the ladder leaning against a home
*  Sets a random range for both the ladder size in feet, and the angle it has against the house
*  Then converts it to radians, calculates the height and distance the ladder is from the house
*  Outputs all answers after the illustration pop-up
